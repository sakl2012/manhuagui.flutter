# ManHuaGui Flutter

iPad/Tablet app to read comics on [ManHuaGui](https://www.manhuagui.com).

In this fork, the UI is mostly translated into Traditional Chinese.

## Getting Started

1. Copy `config.dart` from `config.demo.dart`
    > `cp ./lib/config.demo.dart ./lib/config.demo.dart`
1. You can either leave the `config.dart` as it is or change it to your own Mongodb URL.
1. Run `flutter run --release` to install on real devices.

> To build iOS app, you may need to create an empty Flutter project and copy it ios folder.
